Welcome to the repository for *sweddie*, a companion R package containing data ingestion, query, and reporting tools for the Soil Warming Experiment to Depth Data Integration Effort (SWEDDIE).

To get started, install *sweddie* using devtools::install_github("https://github.com/jb388/sweddie"), and then load as usual, i.e., library(sweddie). Next, visit: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18237777> to download SWEDDIE v1.0.0. This version of the database contains all core data (experimental warming infrastructure, site characteristics, plot layout/experimental design) as well as soil temperature and moisture timeseries data. Once the data are downloaded and unzipped you can deploy the functions in the *sweddie* R package. 

Note that the package is still in beta with testing ongoing. Please notify us with any code issues, package concerns, or questions via the [Issues](https://github.com/jb388/sweddie/issues) page. 

The package may be on CRAN eventually but we encourage you to install the most recent (beta) version of the package here for best results.
