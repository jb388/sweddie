Welcome to the repository for *sweddie*, a companion R package containing data ingestion, query, and reporting tools for the Soil Warming Experiment to Depth Data Integration Effort (SWEDDIE).

This package is still in beta with testing ongoing. Expect the package to be updated beyond 1.0.0. in early 2026.

Eventually we expect to submit the package to CRAN, but we encourage you to install the most recent (beta) version of the package from here.
